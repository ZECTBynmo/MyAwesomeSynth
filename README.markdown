# MyAwesomeSynth

Author: Matt Sonic
Purpose: Demonstrate a simple synthesizer using JUCE.
Language: C++

## Features

* MVC structure
* Parameter manager simplifies automation
* Compatible with JUCE 1.50

## Known Issues

* Only tested on OSX 10.6. Code should compile cleanly for Windows & Linux, but the project files have not been tested and probably don't work.
